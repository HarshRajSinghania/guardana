"""Capture the documents each published Guardana release wrote, for the historical corpus.

Every release on PyPI from 0.2.0 on is installed in isolation, resolved against the index
as it stood when that release was published, and fed inputs this script builds: a
directory holding one finding, a scripted OpenAI-compatible endpoint and a capture
collector on 127.0.0.1, a pack, and two datasets. A document is kept under
`packages/guardana-core/tests/historical/<kind>/<release>.<ext>` when its declared version
or its key paths differ from the last one kept for that kind; `historical/releases.json`
records what each release produced, or why it did not.

Profiles have a second source: every fenced YAML block in a release's own `docs/` at its
tag whose top-level keys are all profile keys. Each is handed to that release's `scan
--profile`, then to a `probe --profile` of the scripted endpoint when the scan refuses it;
one either loads is kept as `profile/<release>-<n>.yaml` when no profile kept
before declares its version with its key paths, and one it refuses is recorded with the
reason under `profile_examples` and never stored.

    uv run python scripts/capture_historical_documents.py --dry-run   # the plan, no installs
    uv run python scripts/capture_historical_documents.py             # capture every release
    uv run python scripts/capture_historical_documents.py --profiles-only   # profiles alone

`--profiles-only` takes the releases and their index times from `releases.json`, replaces
only `profile/` and the profile entries of that record, and leaves every other kind as it is.

Needs the network (the PyPI JSON API and the index), `uv`, Python 3.12 known to `uv`, and
the release tags in this clone.
Exit codes: 0 the corpus was written or the plan printed, 1 a release failed a command it
has, or something this script depends on did not hold (the reason is printed).
