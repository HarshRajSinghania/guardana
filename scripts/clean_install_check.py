"""Install the five packages into an empty environment and run the documented commands.

The gate runs in one environment, and it is the one environment a user does not
have: everything is installed, including things nothing declares. That is how
`0.9.0` was tagged with a `guardana` that crashed on **every** command
(`ModuleNotFoundError: click`, because Typer 0.26 vendored Click and stopped
requiring it). Nothing in ruff, mypy, pytest or the dogfood scan could see it.

So this does what a user does: an empty virtual environment, the five
distributions, and then the commands the documentation tells people to type. It
asserts exit codes, not just absence of a crash — a scanner that prints
"No findings" because no rule loaded is the failure this project exists to
prevent, and it exits `0` while doing it.

    uv run python scripts/clean_install_check.py
    uv run python scripts/clean_install_check.py --keep   # leave the venv to poke at

Run it before every tag. CI runs it on every push (`clean-install` job).
