# Recipe: probe your real application

Probe the system your users talk to. A model server without your application's system prompt, tools or data tests the model, not the application. Point the probe at the endpoint your application exposes. The commands below assume it speaks the OpenAI-compatible chat API; if it has its own request and response format, write an adapter first and add `--adapter adapter.yaml` to each command ([guarded endpoints](usage-probe.md#probing-a-guarded-endpoint)).

```bash
guardana plan probe --url https://staging.example.com --model my-app --max-requests 50
guardana target inspect --url https://staging.example.com --model my-app --require chat
guardana probe --url https://staging.example.com --model my-app --max-requests 50 --format json --output run.json
```

1. `plan probe` estimates the cost and lists what would run without sending a request.
2. `target inspect` sends three requests to find out what the endpoint can do, and lists what it declares but could not confirm. It informs you; it does not configure the probe. A rule whose capability the target does not declare is skipped and recorded as skipped; a capability the target declares but inspection could not confirm still lets its rules run, so settle those before trusting the probe. `--require` exits `2` when a named capability is not confirmed ([target inspection](usage-target.md#declared-versus-verified)).
3. `probe` sends at most `--max-requests` requests and saves the run. The saved run records the plugin trust in force (`run.configuration.plugins`).

Probe staging, not production. Your application can act on the model's output, and real probe requests can cost money. Read [safe testing](safe-testing.md) first. Run your own checks, such as the starter's `checks/`, with `--rules checks`.

This does not check the files you ship ([local scan](recipe-local-scan.md)) or runs that already happened ([recorded runs](recipe-recorded-answers.md)).
