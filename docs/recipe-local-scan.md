# Recipe: scan your own project

Scan the files you ship: model weights, notebooks, training and loading code, and configs. The scan runs offline and needs no model.

```bash
guardana plan scan path/to/project
guardana scan path/to/project --format json --output run.json
guardana diff accepted-run.json run.json
```

1. `plan scan` lists the rules that would run and those that would be skipped. It exits `3` if the run could not pass with the current configuration.
2. `scan` reads files without loading them. It exits `0` for a pass, `1` for a finding at or above the policy's severity, or `2` when a check could not run at all, such as a refused plugin. A file it cannot read is listed as UNVERIFIED and does not fail the run unless the profile sets `fail_on.fail_on_inconclusive: true` (`--preset release` does). `run.json` saves the run; it does not record which plugin trust was in force.
3. Keep an accepted `run.json`. Compare a later run against it with `diff` to see whether the result is worse, better, unchanged, or cannot be compared.

This does not check how a model responds to a question. Use [`probe`](recipe-real-application.md) for that. The scan does not load or execute the files it reads. A file in a format it reads but cannot parse is listed as UNVERIFIED, never as clean. A file in a format no rule reads is not examined: any format it does not recognise, and TFLite, which it lists but does not read. Check the formats you ship against [model formats](model-formats.md).

To admit an installed pack, name it with `--plugins allowlist --allow-plugin
<distribution>` ([plugin trust](profiles.md#plugin-trust-plugins)).
