    """An MCP server that points its client at an address a client must not follow.

    Authorization discovery is the one place in MCP where the server chooses a URL
    and the client fetches it, which makes it a server-side request forgery
    primitive aimed at whoever is running the client. The specification names the
    destinations: cloud metadata at `169.254.169.254`, where a fetch returns
    credentials; internal services on a loopback port; `javascript:` and `file:`
    schemes, where a URL is opened rather than fetched; and plain `http://` for an
    authorization endpoint that **MUST** be served over HTTPS.

    The check and the guard are the same code path, and that is the point. Guardana
    refuses to fetch such an address, and **the refusal is the finding** — a
    scanner that followed the URL to prove it was dangerous would have performed
    the attack in order to report it, which is the confused deputy this whole area
    is about.

    The cloud metadata addresses, link-local, multicast and reserved ranges are
    refused however local the server under test is. Every other address that is not
    globally routable — loopback, private, shared and carrier-grade ranges alike —
    is refused only when the server under test is not itself local. A development
    server on `127.0.0.1` pointing at an authorization server on `127.0.0.1` is a
    normal setup, and reporting it would make this rule noise on the first machine
    anybody tries it on.

    A protected resource document that came back but could not be read hides the
    authorization server it names, so the rule declines there. One that was never
    published names nothing, and leaves nothing unseen.
