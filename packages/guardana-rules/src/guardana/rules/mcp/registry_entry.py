    """An MCP server that is not the one its registry entry publishes.

    Neither MCP revision defines registry metadata a client can observe, and what a
    server reports about itself is self-reported. What a team can check is whether the
    server it deployed is the one its registry entry publishes, so the entry is the
    operator's input (`--mcp-registry-entry server.json`), never fetched.

    Two halves. Over HTTP, the URL the server answered at must be one of the entry's
    `remotes`: scheme and host compared lowercased, a default port and one trailing `/`
    dropped, the query compared verbatim, a fragment ignored, and a `{variable}` standing
    for one or more characters other than `/`. An entry without remotes publishes none.
    In either transport, the version the server reports in `serverInfo` (or in
    discovery `_meta`) is compared with the entry's: a different one is a low finding
    worded as what it is, a self-report; none reported leaves the comparison open.
    No request is made beyond the conversation's opening.
