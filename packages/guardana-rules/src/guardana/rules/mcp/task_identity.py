    > cryptographically secure task IDs.

    Only `tools/call` creates a task, in either revision, and Guardana calls no tool, so
    this reads what a caller presenting nothing is shown by one `tasks/list`. A fresh
    anonymous session owns no task, so any task it is shown is somebody else's. On a
    server that serves tools to anyone there is no authorization context to bind a task
    to, and the id is all that guards it: ids that repeat, count up or are short enough
    to enumerate are a second finding there. On a server that gates its tools they are
    not, because the context binds the task whatever its id looks like.

    A refused anonymous listing is the conforming answer. An empty one on a gated server
    is conforming only beside a task it hides: one more listing presenting the operator's
    credential has to show at least one, or the binding is inconclusive, as it is without
    a credential (`--mcp-token-env`). On an open server an empty listing leaves the ids
    ungraded and says so. A
    server that declares no tasks and answers `tasks/list` as an unknown method has none
    to grade, which the run records as not offered. The listing is one page; ids are
    read in memory and never written, and evidence holds only counts.
