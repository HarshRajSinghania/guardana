"""What the two checks over a team's seeded data share: asking as a tenant, trials, controls.

Both rules know which tenant Guardana sent as and which markers each item carries, so a
verdict comes from what was sent and what came back, never from the application's own
account of itself. A control that never returned its marker is a `seed_not_reached`
shortfall and an inconclusive verdict, never a clean one. A reply with no letter or digit
in it is no reply: a case asked only into blank replies is unreached the same way.
