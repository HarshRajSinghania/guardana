    The one check here that works on a plain OpenTelemetry export, because it needs only
    what the conventions carry: tool calls and their arguments. An agent that puts an API
    key into `http_request(headers=…)` or a password into a shell command has moved a
    secret from wherever it was configured into somebody else's log — and in a trace it
    is already *in* a log, which is the point.

    Patterns are the ones the two secret-scanning rules use, so there is one definition
    of what a credential looks like. Precision over recall: no bare-entropy matching, and
    documentation fixtures are allowlisted, because a false positive here teaches people
    to switch the rule off.
