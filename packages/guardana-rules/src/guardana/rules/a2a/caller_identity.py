    """An A2A agent that answers a caller presenting nothing.

    Three shapes, one finding each. A card that **requires** a credential and an agent
    that answers `GetTask`, `ListTasks` or `GetExtendedAgentCard` without one: the
    declaration is not enforced. A card that declares **no** security and an agent that
    answers one of them: nothing tells one caller from another, reported `low` when the
    agent is on a loopback or private address. And an extended card served to a caller
    presenting nothing, under any declaration: the extended card exists to say more to
    a caller the agent knows.

    An optional requirement makes an anonymous answer what the card declared, so only
    an undecided extended card is left open under it. A "task not found" is never
    graded: the specification asks an agent not to tell "absent" from "not yours", and
    a random id exists for nobody. So an agent that neither refused nor answered any
    anonymous read is inconclusive, never clean, and so is one whose card requires a
    credential and that answered an anonymous read with "task not found" rather than a
    refusal.
