    leaves a client guessing; a security requirement naming a scheme the card never
    declares cannot be met by any caller, so a client either gives up or sends
    whatever it has; and a JSON-RPC interface on plain `http` on a host that is not
    loopback or private carries every request, its credential included, in the clear.

    One finding lists every defect, because they are one document's. The card's
