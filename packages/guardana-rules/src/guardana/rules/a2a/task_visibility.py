    """An A2A agent that shows one caller's tasks to somebody else.

    A task holds what a caller asked an agent to do and what came back. Three ways to
    see one that is not yours: an anonymous `ListTasks` that lists any task at all —
    a caller presenting nothing owns none, so they are somebody else's — and a second
    caller, or a caller presenting nothing, reading by id a task the first caller listed
    as its own.

    The reads by id need two credentials for two different callers
    (`--a2a-token-env` and `--a2a-other-token-env`) and a card whose security a bearer
    token can satisfy; without them they are inconclusive, and so is the listing when the
    anonymous `ListTasks` met neither a result nor a refusal. Only reads are sent; no task is
    created. A "task not found" is never graded, since the specification asks an
    agent not to tell "absent" from "not yours". An agent that answers every
    `ListTasks` it was sent as an operation it does not support has no listing to
    grade, which the run records as not offered.
