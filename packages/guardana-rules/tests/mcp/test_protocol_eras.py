"""What the session rules say about a server that is correct under a newer specification.

MCP `2026-07-28` removed protocol sessions. A rule that grades how a session is
minted has to stay silent about a server that mints none — and must not go silent
about a dual-era server that still mints one for every legacy client it serves.
