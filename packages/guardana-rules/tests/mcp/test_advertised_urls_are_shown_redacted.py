"""An address the server advertised reaches a finding without the query it carried.

Discovery documents and challenges are written by the server under test, and any
URL in them can carry a key in its query. Evidence travels to SARIF, the saved run
and the collector, and the evidence redactor does not recognise an arbitrary
`key=value`, so the rule has to show the address the way a target ref is shown.
