"""An agent run must cost a bounded number of model calls, and the bound must hold.

The sibling of `test_scan_cost`, for the dynamic side. It counts transport calls
rather than seconds for the same reason: a timing assertion is either flaky or so
loose it catches nothing.

What it protects: a trajectory rule multiplies a probe's cost by its step budget,
and a step is not cheap — the endpoint retries three times and honours a
`Retry-After` up to 30 s, so one step can take 150 s. If a rule could quietly
raise its own budget, or if a decided verdict kept paying for more steps, a probe
would grow past the point where anyone leaves it in CI. A scanner that gets
switched off fails open at a level no rule can defend.
