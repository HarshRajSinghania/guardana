"""How much one caller may send, and how often.

An ingest endpoint with no bounds is a denial of service with a nice API: one
misconfigured agent in a fleet fills a disk, and the runs nobody could submit are
the ones nobody notices are missing.

Both bounds are honest about what they are. The size limit counts **bytes**, not
the `Content-Length` header, because a header is a claim and a chunked request
does not have to make one. The rate limiter lives in this process, so a deployment
running four workers has four times the limit — written down here and in the docs
rather than implied, since a limit somebody believes is global and is not is worse
than one they know to put a proxy in front of.
