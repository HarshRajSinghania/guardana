"""The upgrade `docs/deployment.md` describes, from the oldest schema a release shipped.

The database starts at the smallest non-zero migration count any release in
`historical/releases.json` shipped, holding what an operator of that release would have:
a run with a finding and a key, written with only the columns that schema has, before
there were tenants. It is migrated forward with the runner the `migrate` command uses,
which adopts both into one project, and then the key issued before the upgrade sends
every stored envelope through the real route. Everything, the pre-upgrade run included,
has to come back through the scoped store.
