    `TARGET_UNAVAILABLE` — the user's environment, kept apart from the gate's
    "ran, found blocking issues" and from our own defects. An error status is
    reported distinctly from an unreachable host: 401, 403 and 407 point at the
    credentials, and any other status quotes the start of the response body,

    `privacy`, the run's own policy, and never holds one of `secrets`, the values the
    run authenticates with; under `metadata_only` only the body's size is given. A judge's
    failure keeps the same exit code and is reported in its own words, never as
    the target's, and so is a monitor cycle its target stopped, in the words the run
    recorded. A run its target stopped part-way is not raised here: it is returned,
    saved, and named by `report_target_stop`.

    `accepts` is the set of flags the calling command actually takes; the message
    names no other one, because advice that the command would reject costs the
    reader a second failed run. `url` is shown without its userinfo, query or fragment.
