"""Load security contracts for a command, and wire what they demand into the run.

A contract that cannot be read exits `3`, like a profile that cannot be read: a
document nobody could parse means the run's invariants are unknown, and nothing
ran. It is never downgraded to a warning — the whole value of writing an invariant
down is that something fails when it is not checked.

What a contract demands is *implied by* an assertion, unlike `trace.require:`, which
an operator states outright. That difference decides what happens when a policy
excludes the compiled rule: the implication goes with it, the stated demand does not.
