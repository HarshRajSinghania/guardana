"""`guardana rule test` — run a rule's own fixtures, including the one nobody writes.

The inner loop for somebody authoring a rule: edit it, run its samples, see whether
it still classifies them correctly. Sends nothing anywhere — every fixture is a
scripted double — so it is safe to run on every keystroke.

**An unsampled rule is never reported as passing.** A command whose whole purpose is
to disprove false greens cannot print "ok" over an empty set of cases in its own
output, so a rule with no fixtures, or with no `inconclusive` fixture, exits `2`.
