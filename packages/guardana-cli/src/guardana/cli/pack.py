"""`guardana pack validate` — can this build load that package, and does it do what it says.

The outer loop for an extension author: run once before publishing and once in CI.
1.0 entry criterion 8 asks in these words that a third party be able to run it
against a release candidate, which is what makes a compatibility promise checkable
rather than stated.

Two questions, and a pack is only a safe investment when both are answered. *Can
this build load it* — the declared extension API range, refused in both directions.
*Does it do what its manifest says* — every id it promises, compared against what
its entry points actually register.
