"""Running the rule set against a live MCP server, and pinning its manifest.

Separate from `_probe_run` because almost nothing is shared: there is no model to
chat with, no canary to plant, and the interesting artefact is a list of tool
descriptions. What *is* shared is everything downstream — profiles, gates,
renderers, the reporter — which is why this is a target rather than a command of
its own.
