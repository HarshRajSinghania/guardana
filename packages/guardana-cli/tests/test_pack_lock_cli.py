"""`guardana pack lock` against the build that is actually installed.

The unit tests build a `Lock` from fixtures, which proves the comparison and proves
nothing about whether the command can pin this machine. That distinction has cost
this project real defects twice: a seam nothing runs is a seam nobody has run, and
the pack-manifest work found its own version of it — a distribution resolved through
the PEP 420 namespace, which named the wrong package and read an empty version, and
looked entirely fine until somebody read the file.

So these tests write a lock from the live registry and read the file.
