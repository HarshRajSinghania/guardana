"""`monitor` must honour the run's privacy policy, on screen and on the wire.

`scan` and `probe` redact before they emit anything. `monitor` did not — it
printed through a renderer built with no policy (so the library default, `full`)
and handed `submit_safely` a result that had passed through no redactor at all.
That is the mode that runs unattended for hours and ships every alert to a
central collector, so it is the worst of the three to have missed.

Asserted at both exits, because they are separate code paths and only one of them
is visible to whoever is watching the terminal.
