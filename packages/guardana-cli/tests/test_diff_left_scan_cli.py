"""`guardana diff` calls a finding resolved only where the later scan still listed its file.

Each case scans a real tree twice through the CLI and compares the two saved runs, the
way a pipeline does: a pickle that was deleted, moved into a directory every scan skips,
renamed to `.bin` or listed in `.guardanaignore` left the scan, and only a file the
second scan read and found clean is resolved.
