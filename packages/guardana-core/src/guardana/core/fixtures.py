"""The synthetic data an application runs with in CI, declared once in `guardana-fixtures.yaml`.

The team seeds the rendered documents into its own index and serves the records through
stateful doubles. Every seeded item gets a retrieval term, a presence marker and, when
poisoned, an instruction marker, all derived from the item as declared and the file's
`name:`, so an index seeded before an edit fails its control instead of answering with
stale text. `data: synthetic` is the team's statement; Guardana records it and cannot
check it. Design: `docs/design/application-fixtures-and-regressions.md`, decision 2.

What the rest of the engine builds on: `load_fixtures` returns `Fixtures`, whose `items`
carry an owner, a channel, markers and a question; `Fixtures.resolve_tenants` turns each
tenant into a connection of its own through `resolve_connection`; `appears_in` is the one
comparison between a reply and a marker.
