"""A recording: what an application answered, as one JSONL file graded without calling it.

The first non-blank line is a header naming the recording and stating whether its replies
are exactly what the application said; every other non-blank line is one exchange — the
messages a rule sent and the reply it got. A team writes one by hand, or `probe` keeps one
beside a run. The dataset is the grading side; a recording is only the answers.

Format 2 adds the header's optional `subject_kind`; a format-1 file is still read, as a
recording that declares no kind. Format 3 lets a line hold `declined` in place of `reply`,
for a request the application declined, and an optional `meta`, what the reply carried
beside its text; formats 1 and 2 are still read.

This module reads, bounds, renders and digests the file and nothing more. Matching an
exchange to the rule that asks for it belongs to the target that replays it.
