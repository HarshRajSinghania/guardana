"""What one run observed about an A2A v1 agent: its card, and whom it answers.

Observations, never conclusions, as for an MCP server: each answer is put in one of
five classes and every reason a question could not be asked is kept, so the rules in
`guardana-rules` reach the verdicts. Task ids the agent revealed are held in memory
for the requests that need them and are never part of an observation.

The card and the first caller's requests are the run's conversation: an agent that
does not answer them, or answers them with a status that would meet every request,
stops the run. The anonymous and second-caller requests are probes, and only a probe
that got no reply at all stops it.
