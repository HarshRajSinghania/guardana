"""What each capability actually promises, as a type a rule can check.

`Capability` says *whether* a target can do something; these say *how* it is
asked. One protocol per capability, so a rule's `required_capabilities` and its
`isinstance` check cannot come apart: a target that can hold a conversation but
not offer tools satisfies `ChatEndpoint` and not `ToolOfferingEndpoint`.

Selection still belongs to the runner. The protocol is the narrower question asked
at the point of use — a type, so `mypy --strict` verifies the call and a third
party's target satisfies it without inheriting anything of ours.

Why the contract needed this: `docs/design/capability-protocols.md`.
