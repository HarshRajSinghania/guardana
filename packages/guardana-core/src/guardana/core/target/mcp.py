    """A live MCP server under test — its tool manifest, and how it authorizes a caller.

    A poisoned tool description is indirect prompt injection with an audience of
    one: the agent's model reads it as trusted instruction. Reading it from a file
    catches it before adoption; reading it from the running server is what catches
    a description changed *after* adoption, which is the whole shape of a rug pull.

    Underneath the manifest sits the authorization surface, and that is where a
    deployed MCP server actually fails: a token minted for something else, a
    session id that is a counter, scopes that cannot express least privilege. This
    target observes those; it never judges them. What an observation *means* is a
    rule's business, which is what keeps the engine free of security opinions and
    lets a profile switch one off.

    The protocol underneath it has two eras, and this target speaks both: which one
    a given server is in gets settled once, before any question is asked, and is
    recorded in the run manifest so a later comparison can say the two runs graded
    different revisions rather than that the system changed. The negotiation is one
    live record the authorization view reads too, so a server that drops the agreed
    revision part-way stops the run instead of being graded in two revisions. See
    `docs/design/mcp-protocol-eras.md`.

    `sender` carries the server's own requests and `discovery_sender` the discovery
    documents at addresses the server named. With neither, both are the built-in
    pinned client; a `sender` without a `discovery_sender` is refused, so a supplied
    transport can neither skip the pin nor send a test suite's discovery to the network.

    `registry_entry` is the operator's copy of the server's registry `server.json`;
    `REGISTRY_ENTRY` is declared only when one was given, over HTTP or stdio.

    Kind is `endpoint` — this is a live service, not files. It advertises
    `LIST_TOOLS` always, so every chat rule is skipped against it by capability
    rather than by a type check that could quietly return nothing, and
    `INSPECT_AUTHORIZATION` **only over HTTP**: the specification says an stdio
    server should take its credentials from the environment instead of following
    the authorization spec, so grading one against OAuth requirements would be
    inventing a verdict. A skipped rule says so; a passed one would not.
