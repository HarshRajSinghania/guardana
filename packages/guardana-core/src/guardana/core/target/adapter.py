"""A configurable request/response adapter for a guarded product endpoint.

The built-in transports speak the OpenAI/Ollama/TGI wire shapes. A real product
endpoint usually sits behind its own contract — a custom auth header, a body like
`{"message": ..., "user_id_hash": ...}`, a reply wrapped in `{"data": {...}}`.
This transport lets a probe hit *that* endpoint (and so exercise its guardrails,
not just the bare model) by mapping the request and response with a small config:
a body template carrying a `{{prompt}}` slot, static headers, and a dotted path to
the reply text. It is fail-closed: a body with no prompt slot, or a response whose
path does not resolve to text, is an error, never a silent empty exchange.

A guard's own answers are mapped too: `declines` names the replies that are a
decline rather than the model's reply, `retry_statuses` the statuses asked again, and
`metadata_paths` what each reply says beside its text.
