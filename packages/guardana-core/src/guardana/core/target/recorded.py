"""Replay a recording through the chat surface, one rule at a time.

A rule talks to a `RecordedTarget` exactly as it talks to a live endpoint, through a view
the runner asks for with `for_rule`. Each view answers only from its own rule's lines, so
two rules asking the same question each read their own replies. A question the recording
cannot answer, or a reply it holds only in altered form, raises `ReplyUnavailable` and is
kept in the target's ledger, so the runner can refuse to read the rule as passed even when
the rule swallowed the exception.
