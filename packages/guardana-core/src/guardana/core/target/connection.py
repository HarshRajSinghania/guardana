"""How to reach a chat endpoint, read the same way from command-line flags and a judge block.

A `Connection` is what was written: a URL, a model, and optionally a provider, the name
of the variable holding a key, and an adapter file. `resolve_connection` checks it and
returns what a transport needs, refusing before any request every combination that would
send something other than what the run says it sends.

A secret is read only for a connection that will send. A plan prices a run and a lock
pins one; neither needs the key, so neither may fail for the want of it.
