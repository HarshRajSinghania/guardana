"""Build the evaluators a profile configures under `evaluators:` and register them.

The judge's differentiating value is that it grades "did the attack succeed" — but
it needs a model to ask, and nothing built one from config until here. Both the
judge and the optional guard model are ordinary endpoints, so they can point at a
local OpenAI-compatible server for fully offline grading. Absent config leaves an
evaluator unregistered, and a rule that names it is then skipped visibly by the
runner — never a silent pass.

A judge block is read as a `Connection` (`endpoint` is its URL), so it takes a
provider and an adapter as the endpoint commands do, and a key variable that is unset
or empty is refused before a judge is asked anything.

    The endpoint is digested after canonicalisation, never written out: a URL can carry
    credentials in its userinfo or query, and two spellings of one server must not read
    as two judges. A provider and an adapter are named only when the block sets them,
    so the identity of a block that sets neither does not move.
