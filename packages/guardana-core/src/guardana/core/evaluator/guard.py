    """Grade a model response with an external safety-classifier (guard) model.

    Opt-in only — never Guardana's always-on gate: a guard used as the default
    all-clear fails open, because open-weight guards miss a large fraction of
    unsafe content. A guard's unsafe verdict is a finding at conservative
    confidence; a reply that is neither a recognized safe nor unsafe verdict is
    `inconclusive`, never a silent pass.

    Every non-blank reply under grade goes to the guard in one call, joined: unsafe
    text in an agent run's first step is unsafe whatever the run ended with, and one
    call per verdict keeps the planned judge cost true.

    `classify` sends the content to the guard and returns its raw reply; the
    wiring builds it from a guard endpoint, so the guard is just another target.
    `judge_identity` is what the wiring states about that guard (its model and
    endpoint), so a calibration of one guard is never applied to another.
