"""Find installed pack manifests, and check each against what its package registers.

A manifest is a claim; this is where the claim meets the registry. The direction
that matters is the *missing* one: a pack promising `acme.agent.customer_data` and
not registering it leaves a team believing a check runs that never does — which is
the same false green the engine refuses everywhere else, arriving through
documentation instead of through code.
