"""What was installed, pinned by what each thing *is* rather than by what it is called.

A lock over distribution versions is not a lock for this project, and the reason is
already in the codebase: `Rule.digest()` exists precisely so that "the same rule"
means more than "the same package version". A pack can sharpen a corpus, widen a
prompt set or swap an evaluator inside one patch release, and every one of those
changes what a run tests while the version string it is pinned by says nothing
moved. A comparison against last week's run would then blame the model.

So this pins three different things with three different strengths, and says which
is which rather than presenting one confidence:

- **rules** by digest — their declaration, hashed. A changed corpus is visible;
- **evaluators, targets, renderers and reporters** by id only. They are Python and
  have no declaration to hash, and inventing a digest from a class name would claim
  to detect a change it cannot see. `_run_meta` made that call for the run manifest
  and it is the same call here;
- **catalogues** by a digest over the references a pack registers. A third-party
  catalogue has no *file* to pin — a pack registers refs through an entry point —
  but what it registered is content, and content hashes.

The distribution version is recorded beside all of it as the coarse pin that covers
what none of the above can: the Python implementation behind a rule whose
declaration did not move.

A lock is a document a team keeps in their repository and reads on every CI run, so
