"""A team's recipe: what its checks are, what answers them, and the lock that pins both.

The recipe is hand-written and reviewed; Guardana never rewrites it. The lock is generated
from the plan of the recipe's run and pins what a run already records about itself — rule
digests, the profile digest, judge identities — plus what those records miss: calibration
contents, the distribution behind every rule, evaluator and installed target, plugin trust,
the subject's own reviewed files and the files of every distribution installed from a
directory or a URL. Design: `docs/design/team-recipes.md`,
