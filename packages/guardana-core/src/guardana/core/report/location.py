"""Relativize a `Finding.target_ref` path for portable rendering and baselining.

A static finding's `target_ref` is `"path:line"`; a dynamic one is `"url#model"`.
Rewriting file paths relative to the checkout root gives the SARIF renderer a
repo-relative `uri` (what GitHub code scanning needs to attach an alert) and gives
the baseline fingerprint a path that is stable between a dev machine and CI.
