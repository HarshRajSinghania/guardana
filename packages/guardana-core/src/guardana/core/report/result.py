    """Everything one run produced: what was found, what ran, and what was skipped.

    `rules_run` names the rules rather than counting them, and `rules_skipped` is
    part of the result on purpose, and each skip carries *why* — a scan that
    quietly ran half the rules it claimed to would be worse than no scan, and a
    rule skipped because the provider cannot do something is a different fact
    from one that never applied. A count cannot tell "this rule found
    nothing" from "this rule never ran", so two runs with different profiles would
    compare as an improvement; the names are what make that lie impossible.
    `unverified` carries the
    same weight: a check that ran but could not reach a verdict (an unreachable
    judge, a guard model that declined, an empty reply) is surfaced here, never
    dropped into a false all-clear. `waived` holds findings a baseline explicitly
    accepted with a reason: they no longer fail the gate, but they are still
    reported — a suppression you can see, never a silent drop. `observations` is
    the one channel that is not about problems: the components the run saw, so
    "what is deployed here" and "what changed since last time" are answerable
    without walking the target again.

    `stopped_by` is set when the run ended before finishing its plan. It belongs
    to the result and not only to the exit code, because the report outlives the
    process that wrote it: one that does not say it was cut short reads as a
    complete pass, and its smaller finding count reads as an improvement.
