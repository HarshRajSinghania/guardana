"""Run a rule's declared fixtures and say what they proved — or that they proved nothing.

Separate from `Runner` on purpose. The runner grades a *target* and asks what is
wrong with it; this grades a *rule* and asks whether it classifies correctly. They
share the execution of a rule and nothing else: one produces findings about a
system, the other produces a verdict about a check.

The strictness lives here rather than in the command, so a library caller and the
CLI reach the same conclusion about the same rule.
