"""Prove a regression case on both sides: its failure still fails and a correct reply passes.

A case's expectation gates something only while it tells the failure it was promoted from
apart from a correct reply. The proof grades both replies with the suite's own evaluator
and the case's effective expectation, sending nothing, so only an evaluator that declares
itself deterministic and asks no judge can give it. Why, and what was rejected:
