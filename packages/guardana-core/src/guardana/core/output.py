"""Installed outputs: a format for `--format` and a reporter for `--reporter`, from another package.

An output is one entry point in `guardana.renderers` or `guardana.reporters`, and its
entry-point name is the output's name, so a collision and a trust refusal are decided
from metadata before anything is imported. An output is imported only when a run
selects it. Both kinds receive a `Verification` through `outbound`, which holds no more
than the saved run holds. A reporter receives the saved run's manifest with every text
field redacted again and its target ref at `redacted` mode, and no kept exchange.
