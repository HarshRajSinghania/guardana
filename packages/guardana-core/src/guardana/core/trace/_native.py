"""The dialect Guardana defines: OpenTelemetry's message shape plus the named extensions.

Strict about keys, value types and enum members at every level, unlike the
OpenTelemetry reader: a value the published schema refuses stops the read rather than
reading as a default, and `reject_unknown_keys` and `_wrong` carry the reason. Messages
and parts reach the shared OpenTelemetry helpers only after they are checked here, so
that dialect stays tolerant. This is also the only dialect that can *declare* what it
records, which is why converting an OTel export into it is how an operator adds the
authorization dimensions their framework does not emit.
