"""Reading a trace file: which dialect it is, and what the producer actually records.

Two decisions live here and both are about not lying.

**A dialect is detected per file, never per record.** Guessing line by line means a
file we half-recognise yields a partial trace and a report that reads clean.
Detection reads the first record, states what it concluded, and can be overridden.

**A dimension nobody declared is derived from what is present, and only ever
downwards.** A trace with no consent records anywhere is indistinguishable from a
producer that does not emit them, and both must stop the consent rule from running.
