"""A rule's own samples, and the three ways they can fail to prove anything.

The interesting cases are not "a fixture passed". They are the three states this
type exists to keep apart — a rule that answered wrongly, a rule that could not
answer at all, and a rule nobody asked. The last one is the reason the feature
exists: "every rule has a positive and a negative fixture" was project law and a
`pytest` convention, which meant nothing could check it for a pack this repository
never saw.
