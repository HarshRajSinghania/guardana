"""What an agent-run rule must declare before `delivered_by` can mean anything.

`delivered_by` turns "the model did not misbehave" into a verdict only when the
tool it names can hand the payload over. A rule where it cannot would grade every
run inconclusive at best, and at worst call a model robust against a payload it
was never shown; both are refused while the rule is loaded.
