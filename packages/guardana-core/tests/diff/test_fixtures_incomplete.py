"""Two runs given different fixtures, or fixtures on one side only, are an incomplete comparison.

An item one fixtures file declares and the other does not was asked about by one run
only, so a finding on it that disappears is not a fixed leak. That is incompleteness, not
a note: it fails the comparison whatever the policy says.
