"""A lock pins what a check *is*, not what its package is called.

The distinction is the whole feature. A pack can sharpen a corpus, widen a prompt
set or swap an evaluator inside one patch release; every one of those changes what a
run tests, and a version pin says nothing moved. `Rule.digest()` has existed since
0.6 so that a comparison could tell those apart, and this is that same knowledge
written down before the run rather than after it.

The round-trip gate is here rather than in its own file because a lock is read on
every CI run of every repository that keeps one: a field written and not read back
is a pin that silently stops pinning.
