"""A run that was cut short must not print the tick people scroll for.

`StopReason` says why this exists in its own docstring: a report outlives the
process that wrote it, and one that does not say it was cut short reads as a
complete pass over the target. The exit code carries it — `6` for an exhausted
budget — but nobody reads an exit code off a terminal, and a job summary that says
"✓ No findings" over a run that stopped after two rules is the false green this
project exists against.

Found by running `probe --mcp --max-request 3` against a live server and reading
the output rather than the exit code.
